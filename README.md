![Game Screenshot](screenshot.png)

A twist on the classic **Pac-Man** game with added mechanics: collect a key to unlock gates, enraged ghosts, and a built-in level creator. Done as an assignment for learning Java at the **Brno University of Technology.** 

## Features

- Classic Pac-Man gameplay with movement, points, and ghosts.

- **Key and Gate mechanic**:
  - Collect a key to be able to unlock the gate and beat the level.

  - When the key is collected, all ghosts become **enraged** and move **twice as fast**.

- **Level Creator**:
  - Create custom levels using a simple character-based format:
    - `W` → Wall  
    - `G` → Gate  
    - `.` → Empty space  
    - `o` → Point  
    - `K` → Key  
    - `P` → Player spawn  
    - `C` → Ghost spawn
